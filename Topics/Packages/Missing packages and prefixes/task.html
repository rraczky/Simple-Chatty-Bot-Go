<h2>Missing packages and prefixes</h2>
<p></p>
<p>Kendrick has created a small Go program that reads a value representing an angle (in degrees), and prints the difference between its sine and cosine to the terminal. However, he is missing very important package imports and function prefixes in his code.</p>
<p>Can you help Kendrick fix his code by adding the missing package imports and also the missing prefixes of the functions?</p><br><b>Sample Input:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">60<br></code></pre><br><b>Sample Output:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">0.3660254037844385<br></code></pre><br><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 8 seconds</font><br><br>
